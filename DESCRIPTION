Description: wrassp is a wrapper to Michel Scheffer's libassp (Advanced Speech
    Signal Processor). The libassp library aims at providing functionality for
    handling speech signal files in most common audio formats and for
    performing analyses common in phonetic science/speech science. This
    includes the calculation of formants, fundamental frequency, root mean
    square, auto correlation, a variety of spectral analyses, zero crossing
    rate, filtering etc. This wrapper library for R exposes a large subset of
    the signal processing functions to R in a (hopefully) user friendly manner.
